How you feeling?

23
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:33,779
Good. Yes.

24
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:37,074
It's good news. You're right.
It's not a heart attack.

25
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,703
In fact, everything I can
see here looks good.

26
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,912
Blood pressure's high...

27
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,290
But that's understandable
under the circumstances.

28
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:46,125

Mr. Takavic, sir?

31
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,808
I'm so sorry. Would you mind?

32
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,645
- I have a taxi coming.
- It'll just take a moment.

33
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,569
Could I have another look
at your driver's licence?

34
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,680
For some reason,
this computer keeps kicking this back.

35
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,936
- And this is your current address?
- Mm-hm.

36
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:52,650
Can I have your
social security number again?

37
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,905
Five, three, one...

38
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,157
Five, three, one...

39
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:03,411
That's the pacific northwest, right?

40
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:08,666
- Yeah.
- I got a cousin who moved to Tacoma.

41
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,335
It's supposed to be beautiful up there.

42
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,212
Yeah, it's...

43
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,297
Beautiful.

44
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,924
Oh, I'm sorry.

45
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,551
You got a taxi.

46
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,594
Go ahead. Five, three, one...

47
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,640
Oh, oh, eight...

48
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,560
Seven...

49
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,353
One...

50
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,730
Four.

51
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:37,820
Okay. That's five, three, one,
oh, oh, eight, seven, one, four?

52
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,493
That's really...

53
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:51,083
I've never seen this before.

54
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,588
Oh, wait.

55
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,550
Oh, my god.

56
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:05,848
I typed the letter o instead of a zero.
Ha-ha.

57
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,767
I can't believe how stupid...

58
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,519
I think it's...

59
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,438
Yeah, it's going through now.

60
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:14,648
So it's okay?

61
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,028
I'm so sorry.

62
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,448
- So I can...?
- Have a good night.

63
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:24,283
I'm sorry for keeping you.

64
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,539
Oh, hold on.

65
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,210
Don't forget this.

66
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,802
- Stay warm.
- You too.

67
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,349
Cottonwood mall, please.

68
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,749
It's... it's a green light.

69
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:09,054
Uh, you know what,
I'll just get out here.

70
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:16,478
Excuse me. This is good.
I'll get out here.

71
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,366
Great. Thanks.

72
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,086
Jimmy: Hey.

73
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,171
I'll trade you.

74
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:08,103
Let it go. If it's important,
they'll leave a message.

75
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,483
Kim: You've reached
Kim wexler. Please leave a message.

76
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:17,154
Uh, Kim, it's Howard.

77
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,281
I'm trying to reach Jimmy.

78
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,617
If you would please let him know.

79
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,661
I really need to talk to him.

80
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,956
It's Chuck.

81
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,859
Man: Everyone, clear.

82
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,543
Jimmy, don't.

83
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,713
- Thank you, Howard.
- Yes.

84
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,193
He says it started in the living room.

85
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,071
Somehow, one of the lanterns
was knocked over.

86
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,827
The inspector says it was over fast.

87
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:32,289
Smoke inhalation, so he didn't suffer.

88
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,292
Yeah, they're gonna say that.

89
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,339
Did you see the backyard?

90
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,304
His microwave...

91
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:51,725
His stereo, his, uh, lights...

92
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,272
Dishwasher, all the kitchen stuff...

93
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,525
Everything electric is back there.

94
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,070
The firemen didn't do that.

95
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,156
He did that.

96
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,999
I saw him five days ago.

97
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,960
He was listening to jazz.

98
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,422
All the lights worked.

99
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,885
He was himself.

100
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:30,013
Something must've happened.

101
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,310
Something made him relapse.

102
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,697
I think we should go home, Jimmy.

103
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,492
Okay?

104
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,079
Come on.

105
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,039
Let's just go home.

106
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,055
- Hey, Carl.
- Hey, Mike.

107
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,726
- There you go.
- So this is it, huh?

108
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,563
Looks that way.

109
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,733
You take it easy.

110
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:12,365
So the boss said
he's gonna want the windbreaker.

111
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,702
Of course he does.

112
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,378
Take care, Mike.

113
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,783
Make it go.

114
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,701
What's wrong with it?

115
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,536
You're standing on it.

116
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,334
Look down. You're standing on it.

117
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,586
Really?

118
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,925
Hey. Mike: Hey.

119
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,386
- Heh.
- You two having fun?

120
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:18,348
- Five more minutes, please?
- Five more minutes, but that's it.

121
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,017
- Hey, baby.
- Thank you.

122
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,438
Is that the soaker hose you two made?

123
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,943
Yeah. I can pick her up
the rest of the week if you want.

124
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:34,030
- You sure? What about your new job?
- I make my own hours.

125
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,245
Must be nice.

126
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,873
- Well, since you're offering...
- Good.

127
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,959
Thanks, Mike.

128
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,221
Man:
For the isotopes capturing the title.

129
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,140
The pitch on the outside, a cold strike.

130
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,602
Two and one to the right-hand-batting
McDonald, he doesn't agree.

131
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,688
Turns back to
the home plate umpire, tichenor.

132
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,816
Keith McDonald, last year,
played for Iowa.

133
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,903
And there, defore was a longtime
member of Memphis.

134
00:19:56,321 --> 00:20:01,076
One for seven in the new campaign.
Right-hand batter with an open stance.

135
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:05,622
Hitting with the lead-off man. Nobody
out in a one-nothing game. The pitch.

136
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,416
Swing and a bouncer
through the right side. A base hit.

137
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:13,380
On the way to second is truby.
He 'i/ stop there. Pageant placed at bat.

138
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:18,259
Chris truby had to hurdle the baseball
on its way through the infield.

139
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:22,972
Otherwise, perhaps, he might've had
a chance to take the turn at second.

140
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:28,937
Already with back-to-back singles
and another threat in the works.

141
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,692
Las cruces for madrigal intermodal.

142
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:39,906
M—a-d-r-i-g—a—I.

143
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,286
In all six of their games now,
that they have not taken the first...

144
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:50,041
And would you have
an address for that?

145
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,975
Jimmy?

146
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,480
It's Howard.

147
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,816
I think you should talk to him.

148
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:19,529
Howard.

149
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,740
Howard: Jimmy, I'm so sorry
to bother you with this.

150
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:27,287
The thing is, we wanted to get Chuck's
obituary in the paper before the service.

151
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:31,332
But I'd really like to run it
by you if that's okay.

152
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,795
Yeah, go ahead.

153
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,464
Great.

154
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,593
Okay. "Charles Lindbergh mcgill.

155
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,847
A towering figure
in the Albuquerque legal community...

156
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:49,100
Who built one of the leading
law firms in the southwest...

157
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,854
Was taken from this world
tragically and suddenly last week.

158
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,356
Son of Ruth and Willard mcgill...

159
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,693
Charles was born and raised
in Cicero, Illinois, outside Chicago.

160
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,655
Charles graduated valedictorian from
Francis Xavier high school at 14...

161
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,367
Making him the youngest graduate
in the history of that school.

162
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:13,875
In his undergraduate years
at the university of Pennsylvania...

163
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,503
He led the debate team
to national championship...

164
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,047
Three years running
and won the Larkin prize.

165
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:22,926
He was editor-in-chief of the law review
and won the moot court competition...

166
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:27,096
At Georgetown law, where he went
on to graduate magna cum laude.

167
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,641
After clerking at
the Delaware court of chancery...

168
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:33,061
And the United States court
of appeals for the tenth circuit...

169
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:36,189
Charles joined
George Hamlin's solo practise...

170
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,484
On central Avenue
in downtown Albuquerque.

171
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,570
Over 23 years, the two men
built what became known...

172
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:46,866
As Hamlin Hamlin mcgill
into a nationally-recognised firm.

173
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:51,538
Charles made his Mark
in many areas of the law.

174
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,499
Early in his career,
he excelled in criminal law...

175
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,377
Winning the precedent-setting case
of state...

176
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:01,381
No matter the case,
Charles was known for his precise...

177
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:06,386
Clear arguments and his devotion
to the highest ideals of the law.

178
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,891
Charles was also active in the
community, championing education...

179
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,142
For the underserved.

180
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,729
He was on the boards of new Mexico
charities and a founding member of...

181
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,833
Southwestern coalition for better
schools and native education alliance.

182
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:24,112
Charles is survived by his former wife,
concert violinist Rebecca bois...

183
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,781
And his younger brother,
James mcgill...

184
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:30,785
Who followed in Charles' footsteps
and entered the legal profession."

185
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:37,750
And then there's information about the
memorial service. Date, time and all that.

186
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,545
So that is what I have.

187
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,509
- Jimmy?
- It's me, Howard. Sounds good.

188
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:51,389
- Oh. Jimmy's okay with it?
- He likes it, Howard. Go ahead with it.

189
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:52,849
Well...

190
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,684
All right.

191
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,853
Thank him for me.

192
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,731
And if you need anything...

193
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,317
- Let me know.
- Yeah, I will.

194
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,069
- See you Sunday.
- Yeah, see you Sunday.

195
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:08,109
Man:
Be advised. We have one adult male...

196
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:11,112
Woman: Does he have a history
of cardiac issues?

197
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,780
Nacho: Yeah.

198
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,366
Woman:
And was he taking any medications?

199
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:16,826
Nacho: He took these.

200
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:20,830
Woman: Thanks. We're headed
to lovelace if you'd like to follow.

201
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,829
Don Juan.

202
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,503
Juan bolsa wants to see you.

203
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,555
You drive.

204
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,458
You I know.

205
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,550
Tuco's man.

206
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,094
He's okay.

207
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:24,722
Tuco's man?

208
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,390
Ignacio.

209
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,853
Don Hector had a stroke.

210
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,772
We don't know when he will be back.

211
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:34,357
But listen to me...

212
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,318
Salamanca territory...

213
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:40,279
Stays salamanca territory.

214
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:41,989
Nothing changes.

215
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:48,412
Collections continue as before.
The count must be exact.

216
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,998
Anyone crosses a line...

217
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,583
You stop them.

218
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,544
You have a delivery tomorrow night.

219
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,506
You pick up, you package...

220
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:00,299
You distribute.

221
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,927
All as you've done before.

222
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:04,929
Do you understand?

223
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,978
You do this right...

224
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,732
Things could go very well for you.

225
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,084
The old bastard,
he's always been trouble.

226
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,672
But he keeps his house in order.

227
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,341
Gustavo.

228
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:47,346
What do you think?

229
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,851
Someone will move
against the salamancas.

230
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,980
Which brings war.

231
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,443
Which brings chaos.

232
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,571
Which brings...

233
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,865
The DEA.

234
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,279
What's up?

235
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,781
It's busted again.

236
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,250
It's just the chain.

237
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:24,336
Want me to do it
or you wanna try it yourself?

238
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:28,507
Okay.

239
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:32,011
This is the last time, so watch.

240
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,513
All right.

241
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,976
So you take this, give it a little play,
right about there.

242
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:42,229
Loop it around the big gear, yeah?

243
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,818
- That's all there is to it.
- Okay.

244
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,782
- And?
- Thanks, dad.

245
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,664
Make sure mom knows where you are.

246
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,584
Hi, Denise.

247
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,462
Uh, yeah, it's Barry.

248
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:52,508
Uh, listen, could you let Mr. Eglin know
I'm gonna be late this morning?

249
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:55,719
I might miss the staff meeting.

250
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:01,058
No, no. Car troubles.
Probably just a dead battery.

251
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,228
Yeah, I know. I know.

252
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:06,522
Practically brand-new.

253
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:09,024
Okay, thanks.

254
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,590
Bruce had the speed. He could
kick you before you saw him move.

255
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:18,010
- You ever watched a liston fight?
- We're talking about what?

256
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:21,889
- Boxing? That's something else.
- No, we're talking a street fight.

257
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:25,768
- Street fight? Great, so Bruce can kick.
- We're not talking a movie fight.

258
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:29,646
- We're talking about weight, about reach.
- Boxing is a sport.

259
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,732
Martial arts is life and death.

260
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,068
Look, I don't care how fast you are.

261
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:37,112
Muhammad Ali hits you,
you're going down, that's a fact.

262
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,281
If he hits you.

263
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:42,576
Bruce Lee, he knows the anatomy.

264
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:44,912
He's got the moves.
He's gonna find an opening.

265
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:47,581
Without power,
the opening doesn't mean squat.

266
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:50,834
- How much does he weigh?
- Man 1: Don't know. Maybe a buck-thirty.

267
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:55,130
Man 2: Ali was the heavyweight champ.
He's got a hundred pounds on Lee.

268
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,132
Man 1:
Bruce feints for Ali's head.

269
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:00,969
But he goes low and sweeps him
to the deck. Ali goes down hard.

270
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,429
It's all over.

271
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,348
Does he have a gun?

272
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:07,935
- I'm sorry?
- Does Bruce Lee have a gun?

273
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:11,188
If he doesn't,
it's Ali in three minutes or less.

274
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:14,775
See? That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm say...

275
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,778
Hey, hold on. Wait, wait.

276
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:23,075
Did you sign, uh, Tina's birthday card?

277
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,494
- No.
- Would you mind?

278
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,588
Man 1: You're out of line.
Man 2: I'm saying...

279
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,967
If Lee tried to sweep Ali's legs,
he'll sidestep.

280
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:42,636
Ali was fast for his size, yes.

281
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:45,639
But if he gets hit with a low kick,
he won't know what to do.

282
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:48,142
Man 2:
I know what he'll do. He'll do just fine.

283
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,601
Man 1: You're nuts.

284
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,523
Bruce was a brawler, okay?
He gets in quick...

285
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,539
I got it.

286
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,332
Uh, yeah?

287
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,127
Ramirez, team leader.

288
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:21,420
Ramirez: Yes, sir.

289
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:24,006
Ramirez, what do you
think you're up to?

290
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:27,467
We're just pulling an order.
Something wrong?

291
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:31,305
May I ask why none of your guys
are wearing a lift belt?

292
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,223
Lift belt?

293
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,517
- We don't usually...
- Stop what you're doing.

294
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:39,354
Go to the equipment room.
You get lift belts and gloves.

295
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:42,858
You use them.
Rules are rules, got me?

296
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:44,318
Sure. Sure. Okay.

297
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,361
On the double.

298
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:48,780
Ramirez:
Hey, hold up. Shut it down.

299
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,699
Shut it down.

300
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,889
Uh, excuse me.

301
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:15,724
I think this belongs to you.

302
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,519
Oh, my god. Ha, ha.

303
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:23,023
Thank you. Where did you find it?

304
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:25,484
I need to talk to your manager.

305
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,988
I waltz through security
with someone else's ID.

306
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,157
Nobody gives me a second look.

307
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:37,287
When the rightful owner shows up,
there's no facility-wide badge check.

308
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:40,540
I find access doors left unlocked
or propped open.

309
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,834
Passwords written on post-it notes.

310
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:47,464
Warehouse workers are using pen and
paper instead of electronic devices...

311
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:49,925
Which leaves you open to pilfering.

312
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:52,594
You got duplicate
routing numbers on cargo.

313
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:57,432
Surveillance camera blind spots on
the north and the east side of the floor.

314
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,645
Inventory documents going into
the trash instead of being shredded.

315
00:42:01,812 --> 00:42:06,400
Not to mention loading equipment
driven at unsafe speeds...

316
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:07,776
- Wait. Wait.
- And crews...

317
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:11,530
- Wait, hold on. Who are you exactly?
- Disregarding safe...

318
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,657
Ehrmantraut.

319
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:15,534
Security consultant.

320
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:20,497
Well, all due respect, I don't know
anything about a security consultant.

321
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:22,666
Well, you wouldn't, would you?

322
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,669
Maybe you'd best call corporate.

323
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:29,715
Try Lydia rodarte-ouayle.

324
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,485
Cliff: I'm truly sorry, Jimmy.

325
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:53,405
Thank you, cliff. I appreciate that.

326
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:56,575
Hey.

327
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,368
He was a hell of a lawyer.

328
00:42:58,535 --> 00:42:59,703
Yes, he was.

329
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:04,040
Jimmy.

330
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:07,544
We're gonna miss him so much.

331
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:09,004
Thank you, Brenda.

332
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,760
- Brian: I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thanks, Brian.

333
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:20,474
Man: Jimmy, I'm so sorry.

334
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,351
Oh, thanks. Appreciate that.

335
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:50,295
Thank you.

336
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,920
I think I owe you the truth about Chuck.

337
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:34,965
Those lanterns.

338
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:40,136
He was living in that house
without electricity for two years.

339
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,764
He knew how to use those lanterns.

340
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:47,602
He was careful. I saw it. I know you
did too. There was never a problem.

341
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,857
I know it's a terrible thing to...

342
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:57,654
I don't think what happened
was an accident.

343
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:12,502
You probably heard
Chuck was retiring from hhm.

344
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:15,338
But that's not the truth.

345
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:21,052
The truth is that
we had a disagreement...

346
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:23,305
And I pushed him out.

347
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:24,848
I made him go.

348
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:28,476
Chuck was sick for years.
And after the bar hearing...

349
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,896
The bar hearing
had nothing to do with it.

350
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:33,315
Okay.

351
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:36,526
The fact is,
he started getting better after that.

352
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:41,781
He took more of an interest in the firm.
He came to work. We left the lights on.

353
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:46,912
He was improving until the thing with
the insurance, it wasn't the bar hearing.

354
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,956
The insurance?

355
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:52,918
It was a ridiculous thing.

356
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:56,588
I should've just let it go.

357
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:59,424
I mean, god knows
he's done enough for me.

358
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:02,886
But he kept pushing and I, um...

359
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:05,347
I got my back up.

360
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:07,891
What about the insurance?

361
00:46:08,058 --> 00:46:10,852
Howard:
It was, uh, our malpractice insurance.

362
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:14,189
They found out about
Chuck's condition, raised our rates.

363
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:18,234
Chuck went ballistic.
He wanted to go to war.

364
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,153
I drew a line.

365
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,322
He wouldn't back down.

366
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:23,698
So I forced him out.

367
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:32,457
It never occurred to me
that I could hurt him.

368
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,877
He always seemed so strong.

369
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,213
But he wasn't.

370
00:46:39,673 --> 00:46:42,425
I think he did what he did
because of me.

371
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:53,269
Well, Howard,
I guess that's your cross to bear.

372
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:14,708
Look at her go.

373
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:19,796
So I'm gonna make coffee.
Anybody want some?
