1
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,480
You I know.

2
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,600
Tuco's man.

3
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,640
He's okay.

4
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,800
Tuco's man?

5
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,880
Don Hector had a stroke.

6
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,720
We don't know when he will be back.

7
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
But listen to me...

8
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,200
Salamanca territory...

9
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,320
Stays salamanca territory.

10
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,040
Nothing changes.

11
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,400
Collections continue as before.
The count must be exact.

12
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,040
Anyone crosses a line...

13
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,600
You stop them.

14
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,640
You have a delivery tomorrow night.

15
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,520
You pick up, you package...

16
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,280
You distribute.

17
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,920
All as you've done before.

18
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Do you understand?

19
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,960
You do this right...

20
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,720
Things could go very well for you.

21
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,080
The old bastard,
he's always been trouble.

22
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,680
But he keeps his house in order.

23
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,360
What do you think?

24
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,840
Someone will move
against the salamancas.

25
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,960
Which brings war.

26
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Which brings chaos.

27
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,560
Which brings...

28
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,880
The d.E.A.
